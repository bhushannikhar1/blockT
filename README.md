# blockT
A programming language to help transfer code over wire and execute


Programming languages typically process data. Which implies data moves over to programs for processing. This is general architectural pattern thats prominent. 
With restrictions on data and privacy concerns around moving data, it is more sophisticated approach to move programs over wire to data to operate on data.

To operate on Data, we need to rethink strategy to process data. Its not like we can not process data with programs moving to data with existing technology, but these technologies have so hard wired programming constructs, that choosing different approach becomes more confusing and so launching "blockT". blockT will help rethink generic architectures with programs moving over wire to data and process data safely with results carried over with program.
